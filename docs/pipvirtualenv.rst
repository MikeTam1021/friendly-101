pip & virtualenv
================

.. code-block:: bash

   # Virtualenvwrapper
   export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs
   source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh

.. note::

   Virtual manager software like `VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`_ and `Vagrant <https://www.vagrantup.com/>`_ are also used in larger production environments, and can be used in addition to pip and virtualenv to minimize differences between development environments.
