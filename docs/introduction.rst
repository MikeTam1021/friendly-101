If you like photos on `Instagram <http://instagram.com/>`_, you're using Django.

If you pin ideas on `Pinterest <https://www.pinterest.com/>`_, you're using Django.

If you read `National Geographic <http://www.nationalgeographic.com/>`_, you're using Django.

With Django, we can `read the news <http://www.theguardian.co.uk/>`_, `write comments <https://disqus.com/>`_, `listen to music <http://www.rdio.com/>`_, `download web browsers <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/>`_, `laugh at satire <http://www.theonion.com/>`_, `buy swag <https://www.threadless.com/>`_, `play guitar <https://www.soundslice.com/>`_, `talk to our neighbors <http://www.everyblock.com/>`_, `park the car <http://spothero.com/>`_, `follow hipsters <http://pitchfork.com/>`_, `learn about the universe <http://www.nasa.gov/>`_ and a whole lot more.

Django has allowed for the creation of fun, interesting, and useful websites and web applications since its developers released it `10 years ago <https://djangobirthday.com/>`_. So, what is it?

What is Django?
===============

According to `its website <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_:

   Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

At its core, Django is a `framework <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_framework>`_, which is a collection of best practices, conventions, shortcuts, and helpers for creating websites faster and of higher quality. Frameworks strike a middle ground between content management systems, which although convenient can make fundamental assumptions about the structure of your data, and going alone with custom code that is (hopefully) well suited but time consuming to create.

Django was `created <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/team/>`_ by `Adrian Holovaty <http://www.holovaty.com/>`_ and `Simon Willison <http://blog.simonwillison.net/>`_ while working at the online division of the `Lawrence Journal-World <http://www2.ljworld.com/>`_ newspaper in `Lawrence, Kansas <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence,_Kansas>`_, between 2003 and 2005. After becoming frustrated by developing their websites in the `PHP <http://php.net/>`_ programming language, Holovaty and Willison decided instead to use the `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ programming language, eventually creating a resuable, generic framework in the face of the stringent deadlines of a newsroom, earning it the tagline "the web framework for perfectionists with deadlines." 

In 2005, Django `was released <https://github.com/django/django/commit/07ffc7d605cc96557db28a9e35da69bc0719611b>`_ as open-source software and quickly gained popularity. `DjangoCon <https://www.djangocon.us/>`_, the first Django conference, was in `2008 <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD415FAF806EC47A1>`_, and today the `Django Software Foundation <https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/>`_ oversees all development effort and promotion of the framework.

Django adpots an `MVC <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller>`_ software pattern, which means it separates the data layer from the logic layer from the presentation layer. One of Django's ambitious principles is "`batteries included <https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/stdlib.html#batteries-included>`_," which means that all of its separate parts work together without relying on external software dependencies other than Python itself.

There's a lot more in Django's `FAQ <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/faq/general/>`_ and in the `design philosophies <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/misc/design-philosophies/>`_. Other great historical references are Holovaty's `Snakes and Rubies <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3Y-QoEkPtw>`_ presentation, and Willison's `Django history answer <http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-history-of-the-Django-web-framework>`_ on Quora. 

Who are you again?
==================

Hello, my name is Rich Cornish. I first used Django in the fall of 2006 and quicky fell in love working with it. I then worked as an interaction designer at the same online division at the Lawrence Journal-World from 2007 to 2009.

Today I work as a user experience designer and feel privileged that I can share the lessons I learned about web development from the outside perspective of a designer. I graduated from the `University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign <http://illinois.edu/>`_ with a `master of science degree in journalism <http://catalog.illinois.edu/graduate/graduate-majors/journalism/>`_.

What is Friendly 101?
=====================

This mission of Friendly 101 is to be a guide for absolute beginners wanting to learn Django. Other text have similar missions for other technologies, but this text is different because I endeavor to meet the following standards:

- Easy to read and understand

  All text and graphics are written and presented in a way that is neither too technical nor too childish. The material assumes some use of a Mac computer, but nothing more is required. Organization, grammar, consistency, and style are critical.

- Review related technologies

  Too many instructional texts silo themselves, burdening the reader to figure out the technology landscape. There is great value in understanding what's required, what's optional, what's related, and what are the alternatives.

- Link honorably

  While reviewing related technologies is useful, the text is not an all-encompassing guide to all of them. After an overview and explanation of basic concepts, hyperlinks should be used often to point the reader to a trustworthy source to learn more.

It is my belief that people learn best when they create interesting, useful things as "quick wins," and can then "work backward" to progressively learn more about how Python works in and outside the context of Django. When people feel more comfortable in Django, there are plenty of other `resources <http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/>`_, `frameworks <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_, and `libraries <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_ for people to continue their journey.
