Introduction
============

If you like photos on `Instagram <http://instagram.com/>`_, you're using Django.

If you pin ideas on `Pinterest <https://www.pinterest.com/>`_, you're using Django.

If you look at `National Geographic <http://www.nationalgeographic.com/>`_, you're using Django.

With Django, we can `read the news <http://www.theguardian.co.uk/>`_, `write comments <https://disqus.com/>`_, `listen to music <http://www.rdio.com/>`_, `download web browsers <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/>`_, `laugh at satire <http://www.theonion.com/>`_, `buy swag <https://www.threadless.com/>`_, `play guitar <https://www.soundslice.com/>`_, `talk to our neighbors <http://www.everyblock.com/>`_, `park the car <http://spothero.com/>`_, `follow hipsters <http://pitchfork.com/>`_, `learn about the universe <http://www.nasa.gov/>`_ and a whole lot more.

Django has allowed for the creation of fun, interesting, and useful websites and web applications since its developers released it 10 years ago.

What is Django?
---------------

According to `its website <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_:

   Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

What is Django 101?
-------------------

This mission of Django 101 is to be a guide for beginners wanting to learn Django. Although other text have similar missions for other technologies, this text is different because I endeavor to meet the following standards:

- Easy to read and understand

  All text and graphics are written and presented in a way that is neither too technical nor too childish. The material assumes some use of a Mac computer, but nothing more is required. Organization, grammar, consistency, and style are critical.

- Reviews related technologies

  Too many instructional texts silo themselves, burdening the reader to figure out the technology landscape. There is great value in understanding what's related, what's necessary, what's optional, and what are the alternatives.

- Links honorably

  While reviewing related technologies is useful, the text is not an all-encompassing guide to all of them. After an overview and explanation of basic concepts, hyperlinks should be used often to point the reader to a trustworthy source to learn more.
